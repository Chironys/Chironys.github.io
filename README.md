# Environmental Sensor Housing & Integration Project (V1)
**Technical Validation of Sensor Reliability in High-Humidity Climates**

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on the mechanical engineering challenges of deploying IoT environmental sensors (AirGradient) in the Asia-Pacific region. The goal is to develop a housing system that ensures **data integrity** by mitigating the effects of solar radiation and extreme humidity.

## 🧪 V1 Field Test: Yunlin, Taiwan (Feb 2026)
We are initiating a real-world stress test to evaluate the performance of our current prototype. Key technical objectives include:

### 1. Thermal Management
* **Design:** Passive dual-chamber ventilation.
* **Metric:** Monitoring the delta between internal sensor temperature and ambient external temperature under direct solar exposure.

### 2. Infrastructure Integration (AtmosMount)
* **Standardization:** Native **VESA-compatible** base design.
* **Power:** Optimized cable management for enterprise **PoE (Power over Ethernet)** environments, specifically tested with Aruba infrastructure.

### 3. Environmental Endurance
* **Objective:** Validating seal integrity and material resistance to UV degradation before and during the 2026 "Plum Rain" (high-intensity rainfall) season.

## 📅 Roadmap
* **Feb 12-17, 2026:** Deployment of V1 units in Yunlin, Taiwan.
* **March 2026:** Initial stability and thermal delta report.
* **June 2026:** Post-rainy season durability analysis.
