# AeroScutum: Tactical Protection for Environmental Sensors
**Engineering Data Integrity Through Physical Resilience**

## 🌐 The Mission
**AeroScutum** (from Latin *Scutum*, meaning shield) is a professional-grade housing series designed to protect environmental sensors (specifically AirGradient) in extreme climates. Our mission is to bridge the gap between sensitive IoT hardware and industrial-grade outdoor durability, ensuring that data remains accurate even under the harshest environmental stress.

## 🧪 V1 Field Validation: The "Western Exposure" Stress Test
In February 2026, we are initiating a real-world deployment in Yunlin, Taiwan. This site was specifically chosen for its challenging environmental profile:

### 1. Extreme Solar Radiation Armor
* **The Challenge:** Intense **Western Exposure (direct afternoon sun)** which typically causes severe "heat soak," leading to skewed temperature and VOC data.
* **The Solution:** A dual-chamber passive ventilation structure designed to isolate the sensor core from radiant heat while maintaining a high rate of natural convection.

### 2. The AtmosMount Standard
* **Integration:** A standardized mechanical interface featuring native **VESA compatibility**.
* **Infrastructure:** Optimized for enterprise deployment, featuring integrated cable management for **Aruba PoE** networking hardware.

### 3. Humidity & Salinity Resilience
* **Testing:** Validating seal integrity against high-humidity and salt-mist environments before the 2026 "Plum Rain" season.

## 🤝 Technical Collaboration
We believe in peer-reviewed hardware. We are actively seeking feedback from the engineering community on:
* **Airflow Optimization:** Internal geometry to minimize response lag (T90) for PM2.5 sensors.
* **Material Endurance:** Evaluating UV-stabilized polymers for long-term structural integrity.

> **Technical Disclosure:** > Mounting specifications (AtmosMount) are open-source. Internal structural geometries and thermal fluid dynamics data are currently in a closed-beta phase for testing.

## 📅 2026 Roadmap
* **Jan 21:** Technical Outreach & Peer Review Phase.
* **Feb 12-22:** V1 Field Installation & Sensor Calibration (Yunlin, Taiwan).
* **March:** Release of initial Thermal Delta & VOC Stability Report.
