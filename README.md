# V-Aero: Engineering Reliable Environmental Monitoring (V1)
**An Open Invitation for Technical Collaboration & Hardware Validation**

## 🌐 The Mission
**V-Aero** is a dedicated mechanical project by **Chironys** aimed at solving a critical gap in the IoT ecosystem: Ensuring long-term hardware reliability in extreme outdoor environments. While digital sensors are becoming more accessible, their physical housing often fails to protect them against high humidity, UV radiation, and salt mist. V-Aero is our answer—a housing system engineered for durability and precision.

## 🛠️ V1 Focus: Technical Validation
For the upcoming **February 2026 deployment** in Yunlin, Taiwan, we are focusing on validating three core mechanical pillars:

### 1. Passive Thermal Management
* **The Challenge:** Preventing "solar heat soak" from skewing sensor data.
* **The Approach:** Testing a dual-chamber ventilation structure designed to maximize airflow while shielding internal components from direct solar radiation.

### 2. The AtmosMount Standard
* **Mechanical Interface:** We are introducing **AtmosMount**, a standardized mounting series that bridges IoT devices with professional infrastructure.
* **VESA Compatibility:** The V1 prototype features a native VESA-compatible base, allowing for deployment on standardized industrial mounts and arms.

### 3. Future Integration: AtmosLink
* **Smart Connectivity:** While V1 focuses on mechanical integrity, the roadmap includes **AtmosLink**—an active integration series providing PoE power management and smart signal routing for enterprise-grade hardware like **Aruba** infrastructure.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Open Science
We believe that hardware is better when it's peer-reviewed. We are actively looking for technical feedback from the community regarding airflow optimization and UV-resistant material selection.

> **Technical Disclosure Policy:**
> We are committed to sharing our **AtmosMount** mounting standards and V1 performance data. While core internal geometries remain in a closed-beta phase, we welcome inquiries from potential partners.

## 📅 2026 Roadmap
* **Feb 12-17:** V1 Field Installation (Yunlin, Taiwan).
* **March:** Release of initial thermal delta and waterproofing logs.
* **June:** Post-Plum Rain durability analysis.
